                                BOWDI in collaboration with UNHCR have implemented GBV Prevention Program in Pulka, Bama and Gwoza of Borno State. The project is to create awareness among the IDP settlement and sensitize them to speakout any form of GBV case and to come together with the Community Leaders, the Soldiers, the youths and all the members of the community to prevent the occurance of any form of abuse within the community and a peer to peer has been formed to . The community leaders and the soldiers were trained on GBV Prevention as they were to stepdown the training to people around them. BOWDI has also organized Dramas, Football Matches and Dancing competition within the communities. BOWDI also participated in the 16 days of Activism by launching a door to door campaign and security by the gate. This have vastly reduce the level of GBV cases in the communities which BOWDI recorded that as a success.
