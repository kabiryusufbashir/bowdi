                        BOWDI is the acronym for Borno Women Development Initiative, a movement to serve as means of educating, enlightening and training of our Girls an d women, exposing them to social environment as developing society. There is no doubt about the fact that most Borno Girls/Women are at the moment in a state of agony, vulnerable to various societal problems and life risks. This is as a result of the difficult living as a result of current insecurity activities across the state, which has subjected them to living randomly at camps as refugees. Leaving them without education or any of its relevance

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        This problem as widely seen, has no concrete solution for the time been, and we fear it can further lead our Girls/Women into a hard way of life. And various dangers especially as they are fragile and thus, needs any form of help to keep them safe. The founding of this movement is to safeguard the image and develop our Girls/Women, Salvage and build their future to add to the economy and reduce the level of illiteracy/ignorance in our communities, especially those affected by the insurgency. This is a course for everyone to put a collective effort , to ensure we help those victims grow a healthy and strong societies. BOWDI is therefore, focused on creating awareness in Girls/Women to set up an unbreakable state and Nation at wide, starting from classroom education to the girl-child, health issues discussion and skills training for our teenage girls/Women. There is importance in Noting that, this is a voluntary, Non-Profitable, Non-governmental and not a political organization, Strictly focused on developing Girls/Women for the benefit of the younger generations
