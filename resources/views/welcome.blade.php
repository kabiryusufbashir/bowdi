                        To achieve food and nutrition security for all people without distinction, food assistance policies and programmes must create conditions that advance, rather than undermine, gender equality and womenâ€™s empowerment. Women's empowerment is a key means of achieving gender equality. It involves women having the same capacity as men to determine and shape their own lives and contribute in shaping the lives of their families, communities and societies
